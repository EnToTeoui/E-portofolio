										<h1>Summary (Deciphering Big Data)</h1>
									</header>
									<p>General view: In this module I managed to grow as a person and gain a deeper understanding of the Data Science field. It helped me work on my critical thinking and analysis as well as my problem-solving skills. In addition, due to the group project we have had, I was able to work on my communication skills, as well as my teamwork and leadership. In this module I learned to identify and manage challenges, security issues and risks, limitations and opportunities for data wrangling. It helped me critically analyse data wrangling problems and determine appropriate methodologies tools and techniques to solve them. It helped me design, develop and evaluate solutions for processing datasets and solving complex problems in various environments. Lastly, I was able to develop and implement the skills required to be an effective member of a development team in virtual professional environment.</p>
									<p>Week (1-3): Data wrangling is essential when working with raw datasets, for the user to be able and work with it, however it can be challenging to prepare facing some challenges, security risks and limitations during the process. Some challenges you can face throughout the process is raw data usually is filled with errors, inconsistent datatypes and missing values. Another challenge is working with big datasets can be time consuming and needs big storage space to be saved at. There are also some security risks whilst data wrangling, as working with large unfiltered datasets can lead to data privacy breaches or sensitive information may get stored in unsecure files and be vulnerable to malicious activities. Furthermore, there are also some limitations to data wrangling as some big data sets require a certain amount of time to be dealt with and can be time consuming. An additional limitation to large datasets is that some more user friendly software for data wrangling are not compatible with handling large datasets. Despite all these setbacks that can be faced whilst data wrangling, it provides datasets that can be much easier analysed and preserved for use. They can also be stored and used more than once which can save valuable time in long term.</p>
									<p>Week (4-5): Data Management Pipeline is essentialyly the step-by-step process of converting raw data to usable data, meaning that the data can be analysed and reported upon. Data Management Pipeline usually consists of 6 steps; Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data storage, Data Analysis and Reporting the data which is the final step. Initially you collect the data from a source, then you clean and transform the data by removing any duplicates, sorting out missing values, data types and transforming it into an easy to analysis dataset. Then you have to make sure that the dataset is stored somewhere safe and it can retain its integrity. And finally, you analyse the dataset with software producing a report that can help the people involved make more effective and efficient decisions regarding the dataset.</p>
									<p>Week (7): Normalisation is used to prevent any unwanted errors or anomalies in the data. It usually has 3 normal forms and is supposed to follow certain rules to achieve those normal forms. for the first normal form you need atomic values and each row to be unique. For the second normal form, the data needs to be in first normal form and also every column that is not a part of a primary key to be depended on the primary key. And for the third normal form the data must be in the second normal form and every column that is not part of the primary key to be dependent only on the primary key itself.</p>
									<p>Week (8-10): General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) is a European Union regulation that protects the personal data of EU citizens and provides individuals with control and security regarding their sensitive information. In Cyprus as a member of the European Union the GDPR regulations are fully implemented and in addition there are even some additional regulations set by the country Data Protection Law. Individuals in Cyprus are permitted to know what data organizations are storing regarding them, they are eligible to request a deletion of their data and limit how their data is being used. In addition they are permitted to refuse for their data to be processed for certain cases. Cyprus has a department regarding GDPR regulations and the national law for data protection and violating these laws can cost up to 10 million or 20 million euros in fines. </p>

									<p>Individual Reflection: (Gibb's Reflective Cycle)<br>
										Description:<br>
										In the module Deciphering Big data our objective was to expand our knowledge on data extraction, exploration, cleaning, and modelling techniques for datasets. At first, we begun learning about data wrangling and then we moved to data cleaning and data management pipeline. After the half of the module, we moved on to normalisation and GDPR regulations activities and finally we learned about API security requirements through some activities. In addition, for week 6 we had a group assignment where we had to provide a project report to design and build a logical database. Our group divided the assignment into 3 parts as we were 3 people in the group and each member was assigned the part that was most suitable for them, and we set a deadline and a meeting at the end of the deadline to combine our work and finalise the project. After the first deadline we wanted to make minor changes, and we set another deadline and a meeting to combine the changes and for the final submission to be made.<br>
										Feelings:<br>
										At first for the modules activities, I was a bit stressed of what to expect and how I would perform as I was not familiar with the modules content. For the more technical parts of the module, I struggled a bit in the beginning but with time I managed to get better and more familiar with it. For the more theoretical parts it was fun learning something new. For the group project I was stressed to at first because people have different perspectives and approaches to getting on with assignments so I did not know if it would work out, however when I met my peers for the group project I was very pleased that it would work out fine as we were all on the same page.<br>
										Evaluation:<br>
										For the module in general, learning about new things and how to perform certain tasks was a great experience expanding my knowledge on data science. On the other hand, because I was new to this I was struggling at the beginning, and it felt quite demotivating and bad. For the project I feel like my part of contributing and in general as a group we did well and did not have many disagreements or conflicts on what to write and suggest for the build and design of the project. In addition, we all met our deadlines that we set so there were no setbacks to delay us for the submission deadline. What did not go as planned, was the fact that the score for our assignment was lower than we expected to be and we were unsure of why that was.<br>
										Analysis:<br>
										For the group project I believe what enabled us to have a good time working on our project was the fact that everyone was willing to help each other, willing to listen to any new ideas from their peers and we worked as professionals with respect for each other and not missing any deadlines that could have brought conflicts between us. In addition, the fact that each one of us was more suitable for a different section of the assignment therefore everyone getting the part they preferred it helped our work to move on smoothly without anyone working on a section they were not familiar or did not understand. What went wrong in my opinion, and we did not get the score we anticipated was probably a misunderstanding or miscommunication for the requirements of the project and we missed couple of points that were supposed to be in the report, but we did not include.<br>
										Conclusion:<br>
										Even though at the beginning of module I was struggling a bit with some activities, I believed I learned a lot from it and I now feel more comfortable performing them. Sometimes stress can be helpful to encourage you to learn in certain ways however I have to control it and not let it get the better of me, so I do not under perform or I am too scared to try and learn new things. For the group assignment I believe it was a great experience, and it helped me develop my teamwork skills in a friendly environment working with other peers. It allowed me to work on showcasing my thoughts and ideas to other people and also be open to new ideas regarding the project or my own suggestions. And if we were more careful of what the requirements were, we could have achieved a higher score on the assignment as well.<br>
										Action plan:<br>
										If I had to do this module again for the most part, I would have done the same things I would say as I think for the most part my approach to this module was good. Even though I struggled in the beginning I kept going and it finally paid off. In addition, my contribution to the group assignment I believe was valuable and it helped us perform well even though we did not get the score we hoped for. What I would have done differently is approach the modules activities with less stress so I could have been more productive, and for the group assignment work I would make sure before working on the project, we took our time to read and understand the requirements of the project fully so we would have not missed out on points in such a manner.<br>
