										<h1>Summary (Deciphering Big Data)</h1>
									</header>
									<p>General view: In this module I managed to grow as a person and gain a deeper understanding of the Data Science field. It helped me work on my critical thinking and analysis as well as my problem-solving skills. In addition, due to the group project we have had, I was able to work on my communication skills, as well as my teamwork and leadership. In this module I learned to identify and manage challenges, security issues and risks, limitations and opportunities for data wrangling. It helped me critically analyse data wrangling problems and determine appropriate methodologies tools and techniques to solve them. It helped me design, develop and evaluate solutions for processing datasets and solving complex problems in various environments. Lastly, I was able to develop and implement the skills required to be an effective member of a development team in virtual professional environment.</p>
									<p>Week (1-3): Data wrangling is essential when working with raw datasets, for the user to be able and work with it, however it can be challenging to prepare facing some challenges, security risks and limitations during the process. Some challenges you can face throughout the process is raw data usually is filled with errors, inconsistent datatypes and missing values. Another challenge is working with big datasets can be time consuming and needs big storage space to be saved at. There are also some security risks whilst data wrangling, as working with large unfiltered datasets can lead to data privacy breaches or sensitive information may get stored in unsecure files and be vulnerable to malicious activities. Furthermore, there are also some limitations to data wrangling as some big data sets require a certain amount of time to be dealt with and can be time consuming. An additional limitation to large datasets is that some more user friendly software for data wrangling are not compatible with handling large datasets. Despite all these setbacks that can be faced whilst data wrangling, it provides datasets that can be much easier analysed and preserved for use. They can also be stored and used more than once which can save valuable time in long term.</p>
									<p>Week (4-5): Data Management Pipeline is essentialy the step by step process of converting raw data to usable data, meaning that the data can be analysed and reported upon. Data Management Pipeline usually consists 6 steps; Data Collection, Data Cleaning, Data Transformation, Data storage, Data Analysis and Reporting the data which is the final step. Initially you collect the data from a source, then you clean and transform the data by removing any duplicates, sorting out missing values, data types and transforming it into a easy to analysis dataset. Then you have to make sure that dataset is stored somewhere safe and it can retain its integrity. And finally you analyse the dataset with a software producing a report that can help the people involved make more effective and efficient decisions regarding the dataset.</p>
