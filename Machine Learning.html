									<p>Week 1-3 (Discussion):<br> </p>
									<p>Week 2 (EDA tutorial):<br> In week 2 of this module we focused on Exploratory Data Analysis and how to navigate through different datasets of test and training. In the beginning we were given a tutorial to go through and familiarize ourself with the tasks and then we were encouraged to undertake a similar EDA exercise to check our understanding. In the following link is my work on carrying out the exercise of identifying missing values, estimating skewness and kurtosis, correlation heat map, scatter plots for different parameters and replacing values with numerical values.  <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/EDAtutorial.html">Link to the code</a></p>
									<p>Week 5 (Coefficient Calculations):<br> In week 5 we had a small exercise to calculate Jaccard coefficient by converting asymmetric variables to binary values. The following link shows the coding I wrote for the exercise. <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Jaccard%20Coefficient.html">Link to the code</a> </P> </p>
									<p>Week 7 (Perceptron Activities):<br> In week 7 we re-visited some coding done in Week 2 and performed some perceptron activities. The 1st activity was simple perceptron by re-implementing the Week 2's code in a more optimized manner. The 2nd activity was perceptron and operator, defining inputs, outputs, weights as well as creating a step function and training small datasets. And for the 3rd activity we had multilayer perceptron. Defining the sigmoid function, using hidden layers, delta calculations and putting together a code to run multiple epochs successfully. The links following are the codes for the 3 separated activities we have gone through.<br><a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Perceptron(1).html">1st activity code</a>, <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Perceptron(2).html">2nd activity code</a>, <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Perceptron(3).html">3rd activity code</a> </p>
									<p>Week 8-10 (Discussion):<br> </p>
									<p>Week 9 (CNN Model Activity):<br> </p>
									<p>Week 11 (Model Performance Measurement):<br/> </p>
									<p>Final project (Individual Presentation):<br> </p>
									<P>Group Project:<br> In week 6 of this module we were required to complete a group project regarding Airbnbs' dataset. In this assignment we had to chose a Machine Learning approach and analyse Airbnb business trends. For our track we chose the Classical ML (Regression & Clustering). My main focus area for this assignment was the regression part. The following link provides you with some coding I carried out to assess the regression of the areas we were looking into to find relationships upon each other.<a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/">Link to the code</a> </P>
