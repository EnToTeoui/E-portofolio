										<h1>Summary (Machine Learning)</h1>
									</header>
									<p>General view (Reflection):<br> After the completion of this module I believe that I have grown as a person and improved my Data Science undestanding and skills dramatically. The exercises we have gone through allowed me to practice my coding skills and challenged my knowledge in each topic we were tasked to discuss. The group project we had allowed me to work on my communication, teamwork and leadership skills and made me realise there is always room for improvement. And finally, throughout all the theory learned, examples showned and exercises we had, I believe, I have improved my critical thinking, problem solving abilities, communication and time management skills. Also the discussions we had enabled me to understand better the ethical concerns such a field can face and how to prevent them from getting out of control. </p>
									<p>Week 1-3 (Discussion):<br> In week 1-3 we had a collaborative discussion regarding the impact of industry 4.0 and industry 5.0 on the sector we are involved or interested in. This discussion allowed me to understand better the Industry 4.0 and 5.0 as well as the benefits and drawbacks for each one of them. This can be a big change in the Data Science field regarding the privacy and ethical concerns this field faces. This is my summary post regarding the topic we had and my thoughts on it.<br>"Metacalf (2024) classifies Industry 5.0 as the evolution of Industry 4.0 whereas in Industry 4.0 the main focus was the efficiency of the automated systems but for Industry 5.0 a more human-centric approach between people and intelligent systems will be held. Regarding the AI and deep learning sector, this highlights the concerns of many people for ethical governance, privacy issues and transparency of the industries designing and deploying these AI technologies in public. Whilst Industry 4.0 brought major advances through automation, big data, and deep learning, it showcased risks associated with privacy breaches and system fragility (Bai et al., 2023). These concerns became more alarming after the OpenAI’s ChatGPT incident in 2023 where it suffered a data leak caused by a Redis caching bug exposing payment details and users’ chat histories (OpenAI, 2023). Industry 5.0 uphold embedding human oversight and ethical accountability into AI system design (Metacalf, 2024). This means that for deep learning applications the main priority would be the safety and resilience of the systems over performance."</p>
									<p>Week 2 (EDA tutorial):<br> In week 2 of this module we focused on Exploratory Data Analysis (Patil, 2018) and how to navigate through different datasets of test and training. In the beginning we were given a tutorial to go through and familiarize ourself with the tasks and then we were encouraged to undertake a similar EDA exercise to check our understanding. This unit allowed me to expand my knowledge on EDA and showcased me how to conduct EDA. This is a really important step for every data scientist to understand well as it is a crucial step for every project. The following link is my work on carrying out the exercise of identifying missing values, estimating skewness and kurtosis, correlation heat map, scatter plots for different parameters and replacing values with numerical values.  <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/EDAtutorial.html">Link to the code</a></p>
									<p>Week 4 (Linear Regression):<br> In week 4 we run a demo of correlation regression and then we were tasked on completing some exercises. In this unit I was able to work on my Correlation and Regression coding skills as well as data preparation for such tasks. The following link shows the code I wrote for the exercises. <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/ScikitLearn.html">Link to the code</a> </p>
									<p>Week 5 (Coefficient Calculations):<br> In week 5 we had a small exercise to calculate Jaccard coefficient by converting asymmetric variables to binary values allowing us to work on our coding skills. The following link shows the coding I wrote for the exercise. <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Jaccard%20Coefficient.html">Link to the code</a> </p>
									<p>Week 7 (Perceptron Activities):<br> In week 7 we re-visited some coding done in Week 2 and performed some perceptron activities. The 1st activity was simple perceptron by re-implementing the Week 2's code in a more optimized manner. The 2nd activity was perceptron and operator, defining inputs, outputs, weights as well as creating a step function and training small datasets. And for the 3rd activity we had multilayer perceptron. Defining the sigmoid function, using hidden layers, delta calculations and putting together a code to run multiple epochs successfully. In this unit we gain critical and detailed understanding of Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and we were able to design and develop simple ANN artefacts. This allowed me to understand better the ANN and CNN architectures, familiarize my self with deep learning architectures and helped me move on with the module with more knowledge on the topic. The links following are the codes for the 3 separated activities we have gone through.<br><a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Perceptron(1).html">1st activity code</a>, <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Perceptron(2).html">2nd activity code</a>, <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Perceptron(3).html">3rd activity code</a> </p>
									<p>Week 8-10 (Discussion):<br> In week 8-10 we had a collaborative discussion regarding our thoughts on the risks and benefits of the use of AI writers at different levels, from administrative work to creative writing. This discussion enabled us to discuss and view different perspectives regarding the issues and improve our communication skills by interacting with our peers. In addition, it showcased us that over committing to AI usage can harm one of humans great abilities, creativity. This is my summary post regarding the topic we had and my thoughts on it.<br>"Hutson (2021) talks about the rise of AI “robo-writers”, highlighting their advancement in producing fluent human-like text. AI writing tools have proved to be really efficient but also raise ethical concerns across administrative and creative domains. In administrative work, AI can automate reports, summarize documents and manage correspondence, allowing human workers to focus on strategic and interpersonal tasks (Davenport & Bean, 2022). These applications help with productivity and consistency whilst reducing operational costs. On the other hand, fully relying on AI generated content risks deskilling administrative roles and embedding biases from training data into official communication (Bender et al., 2021). In creative writing, AI can be helpful with boosting creativity by offering new ideas and enhancing proposals. However, this raises concerns regarding originality and questions regarding authenticity (Hutson, 2021). In addition, if creativity becomes more data-driven humans could start seeing a decrease in their creativity which would raise real concerns about the topic. In the end, the challenge is not if AI should be used in such cases but how can we implement it with minimized consequences. This could be achieved with human oversight and transparent disclosure of such AI implementations to make sure it is enhancing human creativity and does not mask human creativity."</p>
									<p>Week 9 (CNN Model Activity):<br> In week 9 a discussion took place regarding the Wall (2019) article and the thoughts regarding ethical and social implications of the CNN technology. The article even though agrees that this technology have advanced the field quite dramatically it raises some ethical questions regarding privacy of the people as police and private companies use such systems for surveillance without any real supervision of violating privacy policies for the civilians. In addition to the discussion we created our own CNN using the CIFAR-10 dataset. In this unit I was abled to get informed on a deeper level regarding ethical and social concerns about CNN models and improve my coding skills. This will be of a great benefit in the future as a data scientist. The following link showcases the code used to create such a model. <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/CNN.html">Link to the code</a></p>
									<p>Week 11 (Model Performance Measurement):<br/> In week 11 an e-portfolio activity we had was run a model performance measurement file and change different parameters and observe its impact on AUC and R2 error. For example increasing the n_samples, * n_features decreases the area under the ROC curve. At the end of this week we were able to understand the importance of model selection evaluation and deployment as well as apply appropriate evaluation metrics for different ML tasks. The following link is the code of the activity I carried out.<a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/ModelPM.html">Link to the code</a></p>
									<p>Final project week 11 (Individual Presentation):<br> In week 11, we were tasked to develop an object recognition model using CIFAR-10 dataset and explore different Machine Learning approaches to understand their strengths and weaknesses. The primary objective was to design the neural networks and assess the model's efficacy. The Machine Learning Approach I followed was Deep Learning (CNNs & Transfer Learning). This assignment essentially allowed us to showcase what we had learned so far in the module regarding Machine Learning approaches to object recognition models. This allowed me to familiarize myself with such projects and gain required experience to be prepared for future projects like this. The following links show the PowerPoint slides of the presentation, the code used for the model and the transcript of the presentation. The results of the code are not similar with the ones to the powerpoint because the model for the presentation was run in google's colab enviroment with T4 GPU whereas the showcased code is in jupyters notebook where it was ran on CPU. This resulted in having different adjustments of the learning rate, and different early stops. However the code itself is identical to the one used in the actual model run in google's colab. <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Transcript%20Individual%20Report.htm">Link to the Transcript</a> <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Individual-Presentation.html">Link to the PowerPoint</a> <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/IndividualPresentationCode.html">Link to the code</a></p>
									<P>Group Project (Week 6):<br> In week 6 of this module we were required to complete a group project regarding Airbnbs' dataset. In this assignment we had to chose a Machine Learning approach and analyse Airbnb business trends. For our track we chose the Classical ML (Regression & Clustering). My main focus area for this assignment was the regression part. In addition, the feedback we received from our tutor about the assignment was encouraging as it pointed out on the great points made by us for the topic and additionally the mark we scored also reflected on those positive feedback comments we received. For this assignment we were able to showcase our learnings so far in the module but it helped us develop our communication, teamwork and leadership skills as we had to work as a team. These experience will be of a great uses in the future when I will have to work on projects with other peers or co-workers. The following link provides you with some coding I carried out to assess the regression of the areas we were looking into to find relationships upon each other.<a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/">Link to the code</a> </P>
									<p>Individual Reflection: (Gibb's Reflective Cycle)<br>
										Description:<br> In this module we were introduced to Machine Learning with a practical approach, providing hands-on cases of real-world data analytics. At the beginning of the module, we were focused on learning theoretical aspects and key paradigms of Machine Learning and AI, and we later moved on covering algorithms and models whilst applying our knowledge and understanding on exercises with practical case implementation with software. The module included various discussions enabling us to expand on the benefits and concerns that come along with this field’s advancement through AI. We were also assessed on our team working skills, understanding of the module and our knowledge gained through various summative assignments, including a group project and an individual presentation of an object recognition model we created from the knowledge gained throughout this module. In addition, this module aimed to improve skills such as communication and literacy skills, problem solving, critical thinking and analysis.
										<br>
										Feelings:<br> At the beginning of the module, just like every time at the beginning of something I was a bit stressed about what I was going to face but also excited about the new experience and challenges I was going to have. As I started familiarizing myself more with Data Science, I was feeling more confident on what to expect and how I was going to handle the challenges I was going to face in this module. Just like the rest of the modules I had up until now for this degree, I did not have any prior experience therefore I did not know what to expect from this module. However, I was feeling more confident in my abilities to handle the challenges I was going to face compared to how I felt for previous modules. This was something I was working on as well as how I handle the stress of upcoming challenges that I do not know what to expect. I was happy with my approach as I was a bit stressed, but I think I did not let it affect me in any negative way.
										<br>
										Evaluation:<br> I think in general the module was a great learning experience, and I enjoyed studying and learning regarding Machine Learning and AI. The topics discussed during the module were interesting and they were enjoyable to read. In addition, they were important for the Data Science field and understanding some of the concerns raised regarding this field can be helpful for future data scientists in order to have a positive impact and help advance this field. Furthermore, the module included group work and collaborative discussions with peers, which helped me to interact with other people and get to know other people’s opinions on different topics allowing me to understand and see different concerns or benefits for this module through different perspectives. In addition, it helped me develop some important skills of mine such as critical thinking, problem solving ability and teamwork. Additionally, it helped me understand ethical awareness issues raised by different approaches and advancements in this field.
										<br>
										Analysis:<br> Mainly the reason why the module in my opinion went so well and smoothly was the structure of the module and probably because the things we were learning about were interesting for me, so it kept me going. The module’s structure was really great allowing me to follow the module by learning the theory behind what we were tasked with doing and it provided us with enough exercises regarding each topic to familiarize ourselves with and helped me understand what we were doing without unanswered questions that would make the experience not so good. In addition, the willingness and kindness of my peers in this module to share and listen to new ideas, as well as be helpful in the group assignment we had for sure made the experience much better. In general, the module’s approach on engaging with the students allowed me to have a smooth experience without overloading us with too many activities or too much theory that we could not handle.
										<br>
										Conclusion:<br> The Machine Learning module was one of the modules up until now for my master’s degree that I enjoyed exploring the most. I believe I gained great knowledge and understanding regarding the module and it motivated me to explore it even more and keep learning and reading about it even after this module ends. This module helped me to understand Machine Learning approaches to different situations and learn a lot about object recognition models and the risks and benefits of using AI for such a purpose. It also allowed me to understand through collaborative discussions we had during the module the risks and concerns regarding AI and its implementation deep learning models. Lastly it also helped me work on and grow my critical thinking skills and problem-solving abilities.
										<br>
										Action plan:<br> If I had to do the module again my approach would be pretty much similar to what I did the first time. Some skills I would like to be different could have been my teamwork and leadership skill in the group project activities even though I think they were okay, there is always room for improvement. In addition to that, my time management skill for some activities was not the best and I could have had more time completing some activities and not stressing about time and deadlines. However, for the most part I think my approach to this module was great and that is why I also had great experience, and it helped me gain good knowledge of this module.
