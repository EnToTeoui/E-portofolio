									<p>Week 1-3 (Discussion):<br> </p>
									<p>Week 2 (EDA tutorial):<br> In week 2 of this module we focused on Exploratory Data Analysis and how to navigate through different datasets of test and training. In the beginning we were given a tutorial to go through and familiarize ourself with the tasks and then we were encouraged to undertake a similar EDA exercise to check our understanding. In the following link is my work on carrying out the exercise of identifying missing values, estimating skewness and kurtosis, correlation heat map, scatter plots for different parameters and replacing values with numerical values.  <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/EDAtutorial.html">Link to the code</a></p>
									<p>Week 5 (Coefficient Calculations):<br> In week 5 we had a small exercise to calculate Jaccard coefficient by converting asymmetric variables to binary values. The following link shows the coding I wrote for the exercise. <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Jaccard%20Coefficient.html">Link to the code</a> </P> </p>
									<p>Week 7 (Perceptron Activities):<br> In week 7 we re-visited some coding done in Week 2 and performed some perceptron activities. The 1st activity was simple perceptron by re-implementing the Week 2's code in a more optimized manner. The 2nd activity was perceptron and operator, defining inputs, outputs, weights as well as creating a step function and training small datasets. And for the 3rd activity we had multilayer perceptron. Defining the sigmoid function, using hidden layers, delta calculations and putting together a code to run multiple epochs successfully. The links following are the codes for the 3 separated activities we have gone through.<br><a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Perceptron(1).html">1st activity code</a>, <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Perceptron(2).html">2nd activity code</a>, <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Perceptron(3).html">3rd activity code</a> </p>
									<p>Week 8-10 (Discussion):<br> </p>
									<p>Week 9 (CNN Model Activity):<br> In week 9 a discussion took place regarding the Wall (2019) article and the thoughts regarding ethical and social implications of the CNN technology. The article even though agrees that this technology have advanced the field quite dramatically it raises some ethical questions regarding privacy of the people as police and private companies use such systems for surveillance without any real supervision of violating privacy policies for the civilians. In addition to the discussion we created our own CNN using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The following link showcases the code used to create such a model. <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/CNN.html">Link to the code</a></p>
									<p>Week 11 (Model Performance Measurement):<br/> In week 11 an e-portfolio activity we had was run a model performance measurement file and change different parameters and observe its impact on AUC and R2 error. For example increasing the n_samples, * n_features decreases the area under the ROC curve. The following link is the code of the activity I carried out.<a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/ModelPM.html">Link to the code</a></p>
									<p>Final project week 11 (Individual Presentation):<br> In week 11, we were tasked to develop an object recognition model using CIFAR-10 dataset and explore different Machine Learning approaches to understand their strengths and weaknesses. The primary objective was to design the neural networks and assess the model's efficacy. The Machine Learning Approach I followed was Deep Learning (CNNs & Transfer Learning). The following links show the PowerPoint slides of the presentation and the code used for the model. The results of the code are not similar with the ones to the powerpoint because the model for the presentation was run in google's colab enviroment with T4 GPU whereas the showcased code is in jupyters notebook where it was ran on CPU. This resulted in having different adjustments of the learning rate, and different early stops. However the code itself is identical to the one used in the actual model run in google's colab. <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Individual-Presentation.html">Link to the PowerPoint</a> <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/IndividualPresentationCode.html">Link to the code</a></p>
									<P>Group Project (Week 6):<br> In week 6 of this module we were required to complete a group project regarding Airbnbs' dataset. In this assignment we had to chose a Machine Learning approach and analyse Airbnb business trends. For our track we chose the Classical ML (Regression & Clustering). My main focus area for this assignment was the regression part. The following link provides you with some coding I carried out to assess the regression of the areas we were looking into to find relationships upon each other.<a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/">Link to the code</a> </P>
