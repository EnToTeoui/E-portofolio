										<h1>Summary (Machine Learning)</h1>

									<p>General view:<br> </p>
									<p>Week 1-3 (Discussion):<br> In week 1-3 we had a collaborative discussion regarding the impact of industry 4.0 and industry 5.0 on the sector we are involved or interested in. This is my summary post regarding the topic we had and my thoughts on it.<br>"Metacalf (2024) classifies Industry 5.0 as the evolution of Industry 4.0 whereas in Industry 4.0 the main focus was the efficiency of the automated systems but for Industry 5.0 a more human-centric approach between people and intelligent systems will be held. Regarding the AI and deep learning sector, this highlights the concerns of many people for ethical governance, privacy issues and transparency of the industries designing and deploying these AI technologies in public. Whilst Industry 4.0 brought major advances through automation, big data, and deep learning, it showcased risks associated with privacy breaches and system fragility (Bai et al., 2023). These concerns became more alarming after the OpenAI’s ChatGPT incident in 2023 where it suffered a data leak caused by a Redis caching bug exposing payment details and users’ chat histories (OpenAI, 2023). Industry 5.0 uphold embedding human oversight and ethical accountability into AI system design (Metacalf, 2024). This means that for deep learning applications the main priority would be the safety and resilience of the systems over performance."</p>
									<p>Week 2 (EDA tutorial):<br> In week 2 of this module we focused on Exploratory Data Analysis and how to navigate through different datasets of test and training. In the beginning we were given a tutorial to go through and familiarize ourself with the tasks and then we were encouraged to undertake a similar EDA exercise to check our understanding. In the following link is my work on carrying out the exercise of identifying missing values, estimating skewness and kurtosis, correlation heat map, scatter plots for different parameters and replacing values with numerical values.  <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/EDAtutorial.html">Link to the code</a></p>
									<p>Week 5 (Coefficient Calculations):<br> In week 5 we had a small exercise to calculate Jaccard coefficient by converting asymmetric variables to binary values. The following link shows the coding I wrote for the exercise. <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Jaccard%20Coefficient.html">Link to the code</a> </P> </p>
									<p>Week 7 (Perceptron Activities):<br> In week 7 we re-visited some coding done in Week 2 and performed some perceptron activities. The 1st activity was simple perceptron by re-implementing the Week 2's code in a more optimized manner. The 2nd activity was perceptron and operator, defining inputs, outputs, weights as well as creating a step function and training small datasets. And for the 3rd activity we had multilayer perceptron. Defining the sigmoid function, using hidden layers, delta calculations and putting together a code to run multiple epochs successfully. The links following are the codes for the 3 separated activities we have gone through.<br><a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Perceptron(1).html">1st activity code</a>, <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Perceptron(2).html">2nd activity code</a>, <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Perceptron(3).html">3rd activity code</a> </p>
									<p>Week 8-10 (Discussion):<br> In week 8-10 we had a collaborative discussion regarding our thoughts on the risks and benefits of the use of AI writers at different levels, from administrative work to creative writing. This is my summary post regarding the topic we had and my thoughts on it.<br>"Hutson (2021) talks about the rise of AI “robo-writers”, highlighting their advancement in producing fluent human-like text. AI writing tools have proved to be really efficient but also raise ethical concerns across administrative and creative domains. In administrative work, AI can automate reports, summarize documents and manage correspondence, allowing human workers to focus on strategic and interpersonal tasks (Davenport & Bean, 2022). These applications help with productivity and consistency whilst reducing operational costs. On the other hand, fully relying on AI generated content risks deskilling administrative roles and embedding biases from training data into official communication (Bender et al., 2021). In creative writing, AI can be helpful with boosting creativity by offering new ideas and enhancing proposals. However, this raises concerns regarding originality and questions regarding authenticity (Hutson, 2021). In addition, if creativity becomes more data-driven humans could start seeing a decrease in their creativity which would raise real concerns about the topic. In the end, the challenge is not if AI should be used in such cases but how can we implement it with minimized consequences. This could be achieved with human oversight and transparent disclosure of such AI implementations to make sure it is enhancing human creativity and does not mask human creativity."</p>
									<p>Week 9 (CNN Model Activity):<br> In week 9 a discussion took place regarding the Wall (2019) article and the thoughts regarding ethical and social implications of the CNN technology. The article even though agrees that this technology have advanced the field quite dramatically it raises some ethical questions regarding privacy of the people as police and private companies use such systems for surveillance without any real supervision of violating privacy policies for the civilians. In addition to the discussion we created our own CNN using the CIFAR-10 dataset. The following link showcases the code used to create such a model. <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/CNN.html">Link to the code</a></p>
									<p>Week 11 (Model Performance Measurement):<br/> In week 11 an e-portfolio activity we had was run a model performance measurement file and change different parameters and observe its impact on AUC and R2 error. For example increasing the n_samples, * n_features decreases the area under the ROC curve. The following link is the code of the activity I carried out.<a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/ModelPM.html">Link to the code</a></p>
									<p>Final project week 11 (Individual Presentation):<br> In week 11, we were tasked to develop an object recognition model using CIFAR-10 dataset and explore different Machine Learning approaches to understand their strengths and weaknesses. The primary objective was to design the neural networks and assess the model's efficacy. The Machine Learning Approach I followed was Deep Learning (CNNs & Transfer Learning). The following links show the PowerPoint slides of the presentation and the code used for the model. The results of the code are not similar with the ones to the powerpoint because the model for the presentation was run in google's colab enviroment with T4 GPU whereas the showcased code is in jupyters notebook where it was ran on CPU. This resulted in having different adjustments of the learning rate, and different early stops. However the code itself is identical to the one used in the actual model run in google's colab. <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/Individual-Presentation.html">Link to the PowerPoint</a> <a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/IndividualPresentationCode.html">Link to the code</a></p>
									<P>Group Project (Week 6):<br> In week 6 of this module we were required to complete a group project regarding Airbnbs' dataset. In this assignment we had to chose a Machine Learning approach and analyse Airbnb business trends. For our track we chose the Classical ML (Regression & Clustering). My main focus area for this assignment was the regression part. The following link provides you with some coding I carried out to assess the regression of the areas we were looking into to find relationships upon each other.<a href="https://entoteoui.github.io/My_own_repository/">Link to the code</a> </P>
